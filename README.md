todo:
test it both feature
since gemini response is slow need to have a nice loading thing that most chats have




UI:
make it dark themed
make it responsive when the users changes the size
make it collapsable so they can close if they don't need it and then re-open to same size it was before
might need to make new chats with sql so save info ??
make sure that everything slides when going to next section of page like in slides powerpoint


Only after done on:
try light and dark themed
